** TODO Cleanup & testing of config file stuff                        :v0_13:
*** TODO Testing
** TODO Milestone: Version 0.13 - Config file ----------------------- :v0_13:
   Config file name: `.fix/config`.

   A default [empty?] config should be created by `--init`.
** TODO Milestone: Version 0.14 - 'Aliases' ------------------------- :v0_14:
   + One should be able to define aliases in the config file, so that, for
     example, `fix all` can be used to build all targets.
   + There should be a default alias, which should work for the plain 'fix'
     (without any arguments).
** TODO Don't die on non-existing 'src' dir unless necessary.
   Currently Fix will die if no source directory exists, even when no source
   directory is needed. Fix should only die with this error message if the
   source directory is actually *used* by any of the buildscripts. when using

   Error message: "ERROR: Source dir 'src' does not exist"
** TODO Absolute paths for script, source and target(?)
   What should that mean? Should root mean Fix root, or the system root? Should
   relative paths be relative to Fix root, or to the current user directory?
** TODO Pass more arguments to buildscripts(?)
   Fix passes:

     + `$1` - name of tempfile that stdout is connected to

   While the djb's original Redo pass the following:

     + `$1` - foo.o (target name)
     + `$2` - foo (target name without suffix)
     + `$3` - whatever.tmp (tempfile name)

   Maybe `$FIX_SCRIPT_DIR`, `$FIX_SOURCE_DIR` and/or `$FIX_TARGET_DIR` should
   be passed as arguments to the buildscript?

   If the passed filenames are relative, they should always start with `./` or
   `../` (so that filenames beginning with `-` are always handled correctly by
   tools invoked from inside the buildscript.)
** TODO Buildscript should not run at all if target is unchanged
   Currently new target built into a tempfile, and existing target will never
   be overwritten unless the new target has been updated. But the new target
   does not ever have to be built if we know no changes has been made to any of
   the dependencies.

   When building a target for the second time, the buildscript should not be
   executed at all if neither the target, nor any of the dependencies has
   changed.

   + Add a test case for this. (E.g. by using a buildscript that writes to
     standard error, and having a test case that detect that nothing is
     outputted when the script isn't run.)
** TODO Build output (without colors)
   Some sorta status output for each built target, with indentation so that one
   can see what's going on as the build progresses. `--quiet` option to silence
   this output.

   Apenwarr's redo has a nice output where each level is indented one step, but
   each start with the word `redo`, so that one may simply copy/paste a line in
   order to rebuild from there (neat when a problem has occurred). Do that?

   This build output should without colors, or other fancy terminal stuff.
   (That may be added later.)
** TODO Dependencies
** TODO Docs: Add man page
** TODO Docs: Use Ronn for styling the docs?
   https://rtomayko.github.io/ronn/ronn-format.7.html
** TODO More thorough is_mother() tests
   Should be able to detect an inconsistent state and abort. I.e. it should
   check *all* parent/child variables, and return true/false if they're all set
   or unset and abort with an error message if there's something inconsistent
   about them.

   If $FIX_LEVEL > 0 then error unless
       FIX is set to executable file
       PID is existing Fix process
       FIX_LOCK exists and contains same PID as $FIX_PID
       FIX_SCRIPT_DIR
       FIX_SOURCE_DIR
       FIX_TARGET_DIR
       FIX_TARGET
       FIX_PARENT
** TODO Automatic unlocking of stale lockfile
** TODO Proper signal handling
   Nota bene: Rewrite trapping of lockfile so these traps do not clobber each
   other.

   [[http://www.cons.org/cracauer/sigint.html][Proper handling of SIGINT/SIGQUIT]] is an interesting on how to handle
   signals. Under the headline "How to be a proper shell" there is a
   description of what to do when catching a child signal, while wait()ing.

   1. While waiting for child process, take note of any signal received.
   2. Wait for child to exit, get exit status.
   3. If signal any signal was received during wait:
      1. Check whether child received one of the trapped signals: If so re-kill
         yourself with the same signal (so that programs upstream can determine
         that you received a signal).

   [[http://mywiki.wooledge.org/SignalTrap][Sending and Trapping Signals]] says: There is a core set of signals common to
   all Unix-like operating systems whose numbers realistically never change;
   the most common of these are:

   |------+----+--------------------------------------------------------|
   | HUP  |  1 | Hang Up. The controlling terminal has gone away.       |
   | INT  |  2 | Interrupt. The user has pressed Ctrl-C.                |
   | QUIT |  3 | Quit. The user has pressed Ctrl-\. Exit and dump core. |
   | KILL |  9 | Kill. Unconditionally fatal. No cleanup possible.      |
   | TERM | 15 | Terminate. Default `kill` signal.                      |
   |------+----+--------------------------------------------------------|
** TODO Mother process should ignore $FIX_FORCE/$FIX_DEBUG, only use options
   Reset $FIX_DEBUG and $FIX_FORCE (if set), and use only --debug and --force.
   Child processes still need to listen to the environment variables, though.
** TODO Option to output source file(?)
   With this the buildscript itself wouldn't have to consider
   `$FIX_SOURCE_DIR`, but could simply pipe the output of a `fix --cat FILE`
   (or similar command) into the build process.

   Have a `fix --cat FILE` command which registers FILE as a dependency, and
   outputs the content of FILE on standard out?

   A drawback might be that this could obscure where the dependency
   declaration.

       fix --cat index.txt | markdown2html

   or

       TEXT="$(fix --cat index.txt)"
       echo "$TEXT" | markdown2html
** TODO Add config file for default targets
   Config file should be relative to `$FIX_WORK_TREE`.
** TODO Docs: Small (but realistic) build example
   Google 'sample makefile project' for a good starting point.

   + Buildscript should contain lots of comments about how Fix works etc.
   + This build example should be tested through the system tests.
** TODO Options parsing should split bundled shortopts
** TODO Handle comments in config files
   Comments should be handled anywhere in a line (see 'git help config' and
   search for 'comment' to see how it is handled there).
** TODO Handle double quoted strings in config files
   See 'git help config' for how its handled in Git. (It's very much like the
   shell's way of handling stuff, concatenating multiple words and inserting
   spaces.)

   Currently `scriptdir`, `sourcedir` and `targetdir` names cannot contain
   space (or any other kind of whitespace) because of this limitation.
** TODO Listen to value of $FIX_DIR
   $FIX_DIR should be settable in the invoking shell. When implemented, also
   update docs on this (moving this from an 'internal variable' to
   'environment'.
** TODO Listen to value of $FIX_WORK_TREE
   $FIX_WORK_TREE should be settable in the invoking shell. When implemented,
   also update docs on this (moving this from an 'internal variable' to
   'environment'.
* System tests
** TODO Config file tests
*** TODO Fix should run fine with no config file present
*** TODO Unit tests for save_config()
*** DONE Unit tests for load_config()
    CLOSED: [2016-04-22 Fri 22:38]
    Added tests for the following
    + Too few args error
    + Errors messages both before and after first [section]
    + Unknown (alphanumeric) section names should pass (future compat.)
    + Env already set with relpaths should be turned into abspath
    + Env already set with abspath should be retained
    + Unknown (alphanumeric) config variables should pass (future compat.)
    + Having no config file
    + Config file with missing final newline
    + Trimming indentation + space at EOL
    + '#' and ';' comments

***** DONE Test precedence: --opt over env over config over defaults
      CLOSED: [2016-04-22 Fri 22:38]
      Priority order (later overriding previous):
      1. Default value
      3. Config file: $FIX_DIR/config
      4. Environment variable
      5. Option

      In order read in program:
      1. Environment variable
      2. Option                          (overwrite all)
      3. Config file: $FIX_DIR/config    (set if still unset)
      4. Default value                   (set if still unset)
** TODO Version test should work in detached head state
   Currently, if one checks out a commit older that the last tagged commit this
   test will fail. (It only looks at the latest tag in the repo, not the latest
   tag at the time of the commit.)

   Test name: t/a01-v-and-version-options.t
** TODO Test that compiles are done/not done with incrementor(?)
   Compiled file could be a number that is incremented by the 'compiling'
   process, inspection of whether it's been compiled or not does not have to
   depend on timestamp.
** TODO Always error when using `--source` outside buildscript
   Even if there's no TARGET given, this should always result in the error
   message:

       ERROR: Option '--source' can only be used inside buildscript

   See test case: c07-using-source-option-outside-buildscript.t
** TODO Test building from inside subdir
** TODO Test `--init` option
   Including error message when attempting to reinitialize already initialized
   work tree.
** TODO Error message paths when invoked from subdir
** TODO Passing in environment variables as options
   Internal variables should be reset by mother process, and not affect how Fix
   will run if set in the invoking shell. Modifying any of these in a
   buildscript will confuse Fix (so don't do that!)

   Also make sure that subdependencies do not get the leading `$PATH` directory
   added multiple times.
** TODO Rewrite mkmetadata to accept one argument + rewrite tests
   TYPE:FILE, instead of those as two separate arguments.
** TODO Create dep -> dep -> dep test with modified buildscript for leaf dep
   When building a dep1 -> dep2 -> dep3 chain, see that if dep3 has a modified
   buildscript that produces the same output, none of targets should be
   overwritten, but remain exactly as they are.
** TODO Tests for reading of command line arguments
** TODO Add test for --debug (and -D) option
** TODO Add test for --force (and -f) option
** TODO Add test for --help (and -h) option
** TODO Remove test case dependency on pre-configured dir
   Each test should instead write all the files they need explicitly (including
   timestamps) in the test itself (making each test file self contained).

   This also simplifies renaming of tests, since there will no longer be any
   symlinks that point to a non-existing directory after that directory has
   been renamed.
** TODO Make tests uniform
   Tests should be as uniform as possible to be easily diff:able.
** TODO Test cases should describe outcome of test explicitly
   The test case descriptions should be rephrased to use the word 'should'.

   + 'e09-rebuild-dep-target-modified.t' is an example of this.
** TODO Remove TODO tests in all `t/e*sourcedep*.t` tests
** TODO t/e*sourcedep*.t test cases need to look at dependency data     :NOW:
   (they now *pass* even though FIX_SOURCE doesn't do anything!)
** TODO 'test_init' should set state dir root
   '.fix/state' is the current state dir root, this should be exported in a
   variable from test_init so we won't have to change it in a hundred different
   test files if it ever changes.
** TODO Mooooaaar test cases!
** TODO Restructure tests
   Want separate directories for the various tests:
   + Dashtap tests
   + Fix system tests
   + Fix unit tests
** TODO Profiling the code (using Devel::NYTProf)
** TODO Test code coverage (Devel::Cover)
** TODO BUGFIX: Deptarget saves metadata twice
   Example `t/g04-build-targetdep.t`

       # fix.sh TARGET --debug
       build/DEPTARGET: Target unchanged, keep old target
       build/DEPTARGET: Writing metadata for 'TARGET'
       build/DEPTARGET: Writing metadata for 'TARGET'
       build/TARGET: Target unchanged, keep old target
       build/TARGET: Writing metadata
* FUTURE
** TODO Child/mother process communication through tempfiles(?)
   Mother process could save its environment variables/settings in a file in
   e.g. `.fix/tmp/<PID>.conf`, which would then be read by all the child
   processes (rather that being read from the environment). This would protect
   the variables from tampering by the buildscripts. (Good thing?)

   The child processes could, in the same fashion, write their TARGET
   dependency data into a tempfile (`.fix/tmp<PID>.meta` or somesuch) which
   would be gathered into the final build metadata for that target by the
   mother process.
** TODO Outputting dependency graph
   As a dotviz file?
** TODO Support for listdeps
   Tag certain dependencies as 'listing dependencies' (or listdeps) in Fix's
   internal state. A listdep is a dependency, that lists (or defines) which
   other dependencies. Whenever a listdep has changed we can no longer be sure
   that the dependency graph is the same without first rebuilding the target
   whose listdep(s) has changed.

   If no listdeps has changed in the full dependency graph, then we still know
   the exact shape of the graph, though we might still have to rebuild a couple
   of files here or there.

   All buildscripts are listdeps (and presumably there will be no other
   listdeps but the buildscripts in most projects), but let's say that a
   buildscript pulled in content from several files, which were all listed in a
   file called `list.txt`. If `list.txt` were to change, the number of files
   read by the buildscript would also change. Thus `list.txt` should be
   declared as a listdep.
** TODO Add support for newlines in filenames(?)
   Could maybe use trailing backslash in filename to indicate line continuation
   and newline?
** [0%] Parallel builds
*** TODO Make compatible job server?
*** TODO Writing build metadata in parallel
    When building with multiple targets, each target should build in parallel,
    and each should write its build metadata to a separate file. E.g. invoking
    `fix a.txt b.txt c.txt` from inside `above.txt.fix` should cause three
    temporary build metadata files to be written (one for each argument):

        above.txt--fixing.1      # tempfile of first target
        above.txt--fixing.2      # .. second target
        above.txt--fixing.3      # etc.

    Upon finalizing the build these should be concatenated by fix before being
    renamed to their permanent name, e.g. something like this:

        cat above.txt--fixing.1 \
            above.txt--fixing.2 \
            above.txt--fixing.3 >above.txt--fixing
        mv above.txt--fixing above.text
* DONE
** DONE Tests should be run in tempdir
   CLOSED: [2014-07-07 Mon 00:28]
** DONE BUGFIX: Eliminate name collision with lockfile
   CLOSED: [2014-07-07 Mon 00:36]
   Moved build state metadata into dir '.fix/state', while the lockfile
   continues to be called 'lock.pid'.
** DONE Tests which uses pre-defined metadata
   CLOSED: [2014-07-07 Mon 09:11]
   I.e. a whole bunch of tests are based on a state where a target has already
   been built once. This should use stored metadata (which could be easily
   re-built in case the metadata format changes).
** DONE Clean up and systematize test scripts
   CLOSED: [2014-07-11 Fri 21:19]
   Descriptions in TESTS.txt as well as the scripts themselves.
** DONE Eliminate need for 'sleep 1'
   CLOSED: [2014-07-13 Sun 05:04]
   Instead move timestamp backwards for all relevant files. (Is this really
   needed, or covered by the current test cases?) Modify chtime function to
   work for this.

   Test time went down from 14 seconds to 2 seconds (with 20 tests).
** DONE Modified 'init_test' + added 'cpdir'
   CLOSED: [2014-07-26 Sat 21:45]
   'init_test' no longer helps in creating the directory structure of the
   test's tempdir. Instead this has to be done manually (which simplifies
   reading the test script, since you can immediately see which directories are
   created).

   Added help function 'cpdir' which simplifies copying the relevant data
   directories from the test script data dir.
** DONE Test scripts should use 'title'
   CLOSED: [2014-07-25 Sun 00:19]
** DONE Add test for descriptions in TESTS.txt
   CLOSED: [2014-08-18 Mon 02:38]
** DONE Support for SCRIPT|SOURCE|TAGET dirs in metadata
   CLOSED: [2015-10-27 Tue 08:58]
   Metadata now has a third word for each file, specifying whether the file is
   a SCRIPT (*.fix) file, SOURCE file (dependency declared with `fix
   --source`), or a TARGET file.

   This distinction is maintained in order to allow there three different types
   of files to be stored in different directories, and allowing the user to set
   these directories between invocations.
** DONE Test metadata contents
   CLOSED: [2015-10-29 Thu 15:40]
   Add a function to the end of 'dashtap.sh' which can create the expected
   content for the metadata file, given the names of the files which should be
   in there.

   In (some of?) the failing cases we'll need to generate this before running
   the actual tests.
** DONE Build failure should terminate with exit status: 1
   CLOSED: [2015-11-12 Thu 22:15]
   Exit status 1 should be used for build errors (since it'll presumably be the
   most common error).
** DONE Kill invoking buildscript (if any) on error
   CLOSED: [2015-11-12 Thu 22:26]
** DONE Quote all variables
   CLOSED: [2015-11-12 Thu 22:58]
** DONE error() function should be called die()
   CLOSED: [2015-11-12 Thu 23:23]
** DONE Use `set -eu` "strict mode"
   CLOSED: [2015-11-13 Fri 00:42]
   Inspired by [[http://redsymbol.net/articles/unofficial-bash-strict-mode/][The Unofficial Bash Strict Mode]].

   `set -e` - Exit immediately if any untested command fails. The exit status
   of a command is considered to be explicitly tested if the command is used to
   control an `if`, `elif`, `while`, or `until`; or if the command is the left
   hand operand of an `&&` or `||` operator.

   `set -u` - Write a message to standard error when attempting to expand a
   variable that is not set, and exit immediately.
** DONE Test $FIX_LEVEL and $FIX_PARENT environment variables
   CLOSED: [2015-11-13 Fri 01:56]
   Add a buncha testcases that look to see if buildscripts have the right
   FIX_TARGET & FIX_PARENT, at start and further down the dependency tree
** DONE $FIX_PARENT should be set

** DONE Write dependencies to tempfile, finalize when build is done

   Fixed in commit db8fe3b9aebffbe01e21a47541c9aa21b9dde600.
** DONE Automatic adding of buildscript as target dependency
   CLOSED: [2015-11-28 Sat 13:33]
** DONE Never test timestamp on metadata files
   CLOSED: [2015-11-28 Sat]
   They are always overwritten, as it seems unnecessary (and unnecessarily
   costly) to check whether newly written data is identical to previous data.
** DONE Dependency: Save buildscript checksum even if producing same TARGET
   CLOSED: [2015-11-28 Sat 22:29]
   When buildscript has changed, but in such a way as to still produce the same
   output as before (e.g. someone added a comment, blank line or similar to the
   buildscript), we still need to write the metadata file. (Since the checksum
   of the buildscript will be different, and we need to capture that.)

   Fix this, and make sure test case
   't/b06-rebuild-buildscript-modified-same-output.t' passes.

** DONE Internal filenames look like 'TARGET:index.html' etc(?)
   CLOSED: [2015-12-11 Fre 10:52]
   Currently we pass around $TYPE + $FILE in a bunch of places, but maybe these
   should be collected (and stored in the state files) as one string.

   Test to see if this refactoring would simplify the code.
** DONE Add `fix` executable to $PATH                                 :v0_12:
   CLOSED: [2015-12-11 Fri 18:02]
   Create `.fix/bin` directory, put that first in $PATH and add symlink to the
   current executable? This should make it possible to invoke `fix.sh` as just
   `fix` from inside the buildscripts.

   * Removed `$FIX` variable.

   * Prepend a directory to $PATH with a link to Fix (it is always called `fix`
     (even for `fix.sh`) so that buildscripts always can invoke fix with the
     same command.
** DONE Directories should be absolute paths                          :v0_12:
   CLOSED: [2015-12-14 Mon 19:19]
   The following directory variables should all be re-written into absolute
   paths by Fix early on, and these absolute paths is what then should be
   passed down the dependency chain.

     + $FIX_DIR
     + $FIX_SCRIPT_DIR
     + $FIX_SOURCE_DIR
     + $FIX_TARGET_DIR
** DONE BUGFIX: Always overwrite link to Fix in binpath
   CLOSED: [2015-12-14 Mon 19:39]
   The hardlink created in the `.fix/bin` directory (which is added to `$PATH`)
   must be recreated every time, since Emacs (and probably other editors as
   well) break the link, making the link point to an older version of Fix
   instead of the current one.
** DONE Added `--init` option
   CLOSED: [2015-12-15 Tue 09:04]
** DONE Allow running of Fix from any subdir in work tree
   CLOSED: [2015-12-23 Wed 16:18]
   Fix now finds the work tree root by looking for the closest `.fix`
   directory, and builds relative to that, rather than trying to build relative
   to the current directory. (Buildscripts will always run with the
   `$FIX_SOURCE_DIR` as the current directory.)

   This means that filename of targets on the command line must be written
   relative to the work tree root (for now).
** DONE Set current dir for dependencies
   CLOSED: [2016-01-03 Sun 18:13]
   The current dir is now set to `$FIX_SOURCE_DIR` before invoking dependency
   buildscripts too. Also added test case to verify this.
** DONE Minimize `eval` use -- rewrite `find_work_tree`
   CLOSED: [2016-01-07 Thu 00:51]
   Added `seteval` function and rewrote `find_work_tree` to make use of it
   (making `find_work_tree` significantly easier to read, and localizing the
   hard-to-read magic to `seteval`).
** DONE Minimize `eval` use -- rewrite `strip_path`
   CLOSED: [2016-01-07 Thu 01:20]
   Refactored/simplified `strip_path` function using `seteval`.
** DONE Use relative paths in error messages
   CLOSED: [2016-01-07 Thu 01:32]
   Error messages should output paths relative to the user's current working
   directory, for clarity, and to cut down on error message length.

   Rewrote die() so that it now accept printf style %s sequences, and
   additional filename arguments. Each filename so specified is recalculated by
   die() to that it is relative to $FIX_PWD.
** DONE Added unit test infrastructure
   CLOSED: [2016-01-07 Thu 01:47]
   Currently there are full-fledged integration tests, but no unit tests.
   Rewrite the code to allow for unit tests, then start adding some unit tests.

   Added new class of tests (`t/unit-*.t`) which extract one or more functions
   from Fix, and exercise those specifically. (Previously existing tests are
   all system tests.)
** DONE Rename `echo` -> `say`
   CLOSED: [2016-01-07 Thu 02:17]
   Changed all occurrences of `echo` to `say` wherever the printed content is
   anything but simple hex string, numeric or constants.
** DONE Specify target relative to current dir, not work tree root    :v0_12:
   CLOSED: [2016-01-07 Thu 18:49]
   Target paths given on the command are now expressed relative to the user's
   current directory, not relative to the work tree root. (This is more
   intuitive, allows for tab completion and is also what Git does.)

   When Fix is invoked from a buildscript, the target path are instead relative
   to the fix target directory. (This seems to make intutive sense, but might
   change in future versions.)
   ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Earlier description:

   Currently, if you're rebuilding a target called `build/TARGET`, and
   $FIX_TARGET_DIR is set to `build`, you'll need to be in the root of the work
   tree and invoke Fix as:

       fix TARGET

   This should not be the case. Targets should always be specified relative to
   the users current directory, so that if you were *inside* $FIX_TARGET_DIR,
   you should use the above command, but at the root of the work tree you
   should instead name the target dir explicitly and use:

       fix build/TARGET

   And if you were inside a dir called `build/x` you should be able to invoke
   Fix with:

       fix ../TARGET

   And from inside your $FIX_SCRIPT_DIR, you might use:

       fix ../build/TARGET

   Etc.
** DONE Do not export $FIX_PARENT
   CLOSED: [2016-01-08 Fri 09:31]
   $FIX_PARENT does not need to be exported, as it is only used internally by
   Fix.

   $FIX_TARGET, however, needs to be exported, so added tests for that.
** DONE Options --script-dir, --source-dir, --target-dir              :v0_12:

   CLOSED: [2016-03-05 Sat 23:46]
   Test that checks output of `--version` should be expanded to enforce the
   year part of the version message as well, not just the version number
** DONE --script-dir, --source-dir, --target-dir now check their args
   CLOSED: [2016-03-06 Sun 21:05]
   If provided the empty string as an arg, or a DIR which name starts with a
   minus sign Fix will now fail with an error message.

   CLOSED: [2016-03-21 Mon 19:24]
   Using `--script-dir`, `--source-dir` and/or `--target-dir` together with
   `--init` should result in those parameters being written to the config file
   instead of the default.

** DONE Defaults in save_config() AND outside it?
   CLOSED: [2016-03-23 Wed 17:01]
   Setting defaults to scriptdir = fix, sourcedir = src and targetdir = build
   should only happen once.

   Right now these are set inside save_config() as well as in the --init if
   case before init() is being called.
** DONE Set FIX_{SCRIPT|SOURCE|TARGET}_DIR default only once
   CLOSED: [2016-03-23 Wed 18:26]
   Currently defaults are set once when invoking `--init` and once if no config
   file is found during normal build. Instead they should be set only once.

   load_config() was rewritten to load the default values even if no config
   file could be found.

   save_config() calls load_config() to make sure that the defaults are loaded.
** DONE Docs: Document variables
   CLOSED: [2016-04-22 fre 10:34]
   Internal variables should be reset by mother process, and not affect how Fix
   will run if set in the invoking shell. Modifying any of these in a
   buildscript will confuse Fix (so don't do that!)
